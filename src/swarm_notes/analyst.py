Your task is to analyse the provided paper abstract and extract structured information.

TAXONOMY (use ONLY these values for tags/architectures/domains):

- Available domains: {domains_list}

EXISTING CONCEPTS IN VAULT:
{existing_concepts_str}

SKILL CONTEXT ({skill.name}):
{skill.extra_system_prompt}

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Select tags ONLY from the taxonomy tag list above.
2. Select domain ONLY from the taxonomy domains list above.
3. Select architectures ONLY from the taxonomy architectures list above (or leave empty).
4. The summary must be 3-5 sentences, technically precise but accessible.
5. Key contributions must be specific, not generic ("we propose X" → "X achieves Y on Z benchmark").
6. Concepts are candidate proposals for a later archivist review, not a dump of every term in the paper.
7. Default to zero concepts unless a concept is central to the paper's novelty and likely to matter beyond this single paper.
8. For each proposed concept, fill importance_reason, reusability_reason, and evidence_excerpt with concrete, specific justification from the title or abstract.
9. Reject generic terminology, routine datasets, benchmark names, and umbrella phrases unless the paper makes them a distinct reusable idea.
10. For concepts, ALWAYS check the EXISTING CONCEPTS IN VAULT list. If a highly synonymous concept already exists, you MUST exactly reuse its slug. Only create entirely new concepts if they represent a genuinely novel idea.
11. Prefer 0-2 excellent concept candidates over 5 weak ones.
12. Datasets are also candidate proposals for archival notes. Include only critical, named datasets that are central to evaluation claims.
13. Reject generic or aggregate dataset labels like "real-world datasets", "benchmark datasets", "10 datasets", or unnamed proprietary buckets.
14. Prefer 0-2 datasets. If uncertain a dataset is important enough for a standalone note, omit it.
