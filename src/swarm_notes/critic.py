You will receive one paper analysis with candidate concepts, candidate open questions, and candidate datasets.
Your job is to decide which candidates deserve permanent standalone notes.

EXISTING CONCEPTS IN VAULT:
{existing_concepts_str}

EXISTING OPEN QUESTIONS IN VAULT:
{existing_open_questions_str}

EXISTING DATASETS IN VAULT:
{existing_datasets_str}

SKILL CONTEXT ({skill.name}):
{skill.extra_system_prompt}

REVIEW POLICY:
1. Do NOT invent new candidates. Only approve, reject, or rewrite the candidates you were given.
2. Default to approving nothing if the candidates are weak.
3. Approve a concept only if it is central to the paper's contribution, likely to recur across future papers, and distinct enough to deserve its own note.
4. Reject generic ML vocabulary, one-off implementation details, routine datasets, routine benchmarks, and paper-local terminology.
5. Reject paper-internal subcomponents, helper modules, or local implementation details unless they are clearly reusable ideas that future papers would likely name and discuss in their own right.
6. If both an overarching mechanism and one of its supporting submodules are proposed, prefer the overarching mechanism and reject the submodule unless the submodule is independently important.
7. Approve an open question only if it is a substantial unresolved bottleneck or research question that remains useful beyond this one paper.
8. Reject boilerplate future work such as more experiments, larger models, more data, or better performance unless the candidate identifies a specific unresolved mechanism or limitation.
9. Approve a dataset only if it is a specific named dataset central to evaluation claims and useful as a reusable standalone note.
10. Reject generic, aggregate, or counting-style dataset labels such as "real-world datasets", "benchmark datasets", "10 datasets", or unnamed proprietary buckets.
11. Be scarce for datasets too: approve at most 2 datasets.
12. Reuse an existing concept slug when the candidate is synonymous with something already in the vault.
13. For open questions and datasets, compare candidates against existing vault lists and avoid creating near-duplicates. Reuse canonical existing slugs/names when appropriate.
14. Be scarce. Approve at most 2 concepts and at most 2 open questions.
15. Preserve evidence_excerpt and rationale fields when they help justify the approved item.
16. Always fill review_summary with 2-4 sentences explaining the approval standard you applied.
17. For every rejected candidate, you MUST append a structured object to rejected_candidates with ALL required fields:
    - candidate_type: "concept" or "open_question" or "dataset"
    - candidate_slug: slug string
    - candidate_title: display name/title string
    - reason_code: one of [generic, paper_local, not_novel, not_reusable, weak_evidence, low_impact, duplicate_existing, subcomponent_of_broader_mechanism, other]
    - reason: concise explanation (1 sentence)
